# SLOmet-ATOMIC 2020: On Symbolic and Neural Commonsense Knowledge Graphs in Slovenian Language

This project contains the Comet-atomic 2020 model source code modified for the Slovenian language.

## ‚òëÔ∏è Requirements

Before starting the project make sure these requirements are available:

- [python][python]. For executing the code in this project.
- [git][git]. For versioning your code.
- [dvc][dvc]. For versioning your data (part of project requirements).

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup

### Create a python environment

First create the virtual environment where the service will store all the modules.

#### Using virtualenv

Using the `virtualenv` command, run the following commands:

```bash
# install the virtual env command
pip install virtualenv

# create a new virtual environment
virtualenv -p python ./.venv

# activate the environment (UNIX)
./.venv/bin/activate

# activate the environment (WINDOWS)
./.venv/Scripts/activate

# deactivate the environment (UNIX & WINDOWS)
deactivate
```

#### Using conda

Install [conda][conda], a program for creating python virtual environments. Then run the following commands:

```bash
# create a new virtual environment
conda create --name fastapi-ml python=3.8 pip

# activate the environment
conda activate fastapi-ml

# deactivate the environment
deactivate
```

### Install

To install the requirements run:

```bash
pip install -e .
```

## üöß Work In Progress

- [x] Setup script
- [ ] Folder structure
- [ ] Code for model training
- [ ] Code for model evaluation
- [ ] Add support for 3rd party models (outside huggingface)
- [ ] Add `params.yaml` and modify the scripts to read the params from the file
- [ ] Add DVC pipelines for model training and evaluation
- [ ] Add scripts for storing and retrieving the data set
